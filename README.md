TranslateSign
This project is a community-driven extension of Nicolas Renotte's excellent sign language translation tutorial (link to his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doDUihpj6ro&t=388s). We've made improvements to the original code to foster easier navigation and collaboration for open-source contributors of all levels, especially beginners. Check out his channel for more great ML tutorials! If you're interested in contributing to this project, even if you're new to open-source or ML, please see the contributing guidelines. Let's work together to make this a valuable resource!
